    <p>I was at a mountainbike camp in Finale Ligure recently. I don&rsquo;t count the
mountain biking we did there as mobility, let&rsquo;s look at how I got there, what
worked and what didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h1 id="mode-of-transportation">mode of transportation</h1>
<p>I came by train and brought my bike along.</p>
<h3 id="spatial-constraint">Spatial constraint</h3>
<p><strong>A corner that I cut:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t check the small print of the train companies involved about the exact measures of bicycles that are allowed on the trains. I expect issues in width and length.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> It worked well, the train crews didn&rsquo;t complain and the bike racks were never booked out (means: wasn&rsquo;t tight for space).</p>
<p><strong>Backup solution width:</strong> I had the hex key ready to turn the handle bar by 90 degree. The width of the handle bar on the mountainbike just unpractically wide and a challenge on public transport. I&rsquo;m pretty certain it is too wide for the actual regulations, and some small prints certainly say one has to turn the handle bar.</p>
<p><strong>Length:</strong> My bike&rsquo;s whell base is too long for Spanish trains. In the sense
that the wheel base (middle of front wheel to middle or rear wheel) already
exceeds the specs. In practical terms, I know that on the Swiss <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBB_RABe_502">FV
Dosto</a> The bike fits just about if
I hang it on the rear wheel and compress the fork (practically requires
deflating the fork). The situation looks similar on the
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBB_RABe_501">Giruno</a>. I had a fork pump with
me, but stuck deep inside the luggage. I had used that option in previous
years, where the bike leg to/from the station was much longer, such that I
could adapt to going on tarmac with all my luggage (instead of just a
day-pack).</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> the space concerns probably don&rsquo;t affect city or touring bikes as much,
so for combined bike+train mobility (when we don&rsquo;t consider the bike as sport
equipment) you&rsquo;ll probably be fine.</p>
<h3 id="booking-reservation">Booking reservation</h3>
<p><strong>What you need:</strong> long distance trains (usually) require reservations for bicycles. (Actually a new thing in Switzerland, otoh Italy requires seat reservations also w/o bike).</p>
<p><strong>What worked:</strong> Compared to a few years ago, booking the international trip online in self service worked. SBB doesn&rsquo;t offer it, but trenitalia does.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s annoying:</strong> With the reservation you&rsquo;re locked onto a connection.
Means stress in case you don&rsquo;t make a connection. Means you can only pick
connections that the booking system offers you. &ldquo;More layover at X and less at
Y&rdquo; is hard / impossible to pass. Also means for the return trip you can&rsquo;t leave
&ldquo;as you feel like&rdquo;. Also: bike reservations can&rsquo;t be cancelled. So even if
you&rsquo;re happy with just reserving additionally on a different train than
originally planned, you can&rsquo;t vacate your spot for somebody else. Have that on
your conscience. (TBF: I understand that it&rsquo;s not good if people reserve until
last minute &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; and then cancel their reservation, for nobody to
realistically pick it up. But like 2 CHF for reserving, 1 CHF in return for
liberating until x hours in advance would still leave an incentive to cancel a
reservation and disincentivise blocking off all spots).</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s just designed to fail:</strong> Neither domestic trips on SBB nor the
international trips with trenitalia (probably also not the Italian domestic
trips) can reserve bike spot and seat in the same coach. For my trip, I even
had my seat and the bike spot in different sections of the train, such that I
couldn&rsquo;t go towards the bike to prepare disembarking.</p>
<p><strong>What I actually did:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t care about where my actual seat was, just sat
near the bike, all went fine. I did however ask the Italian train crew before
boarding if that was okay with them. The only cared about me having a valid
ticket for that train. I guess it&rsquo;s also a matter of practicality. Once
reservations are mandatory, the train can&rsquo;t be overbooked and there&rsquo;s a seat
for everybody.</p>
<h3 id="milano-centrale">Milano centrale</h3>
<p>The station is a bit of a mess, in my opinion. Platforms are announced rather
late, sometimes long after the train is actually ready at the platform. The
underpassage - while shortening many trips and recently renovated - is
deserted. Nobody waits on a platform and the cross platform at the head end is
over crowded with people waiting for their platforms and has no waiting area or
capacity to hold all the people.</p>
<h3 id="regional-trains">Regional trains</h3>
<p>The combination of regional trains + long distance trains is also a bit of a
sore spot. There&rsquo;s no reservation for regional trains, which is nice for
flexibility and less hazzle, but means it might be too full to get in
(technically the number of bike spots is limitted and they can refuse to
transport you, especially for evacuation safety) you might not manage to get to
the departure of your reserved long distance train. (Same issue as with
postbus+IC combinations in Switzerland, except postbus now also introduces
reservations). Online regional tickets in italy are not fixed to specific
trains anymore (they gained the flexibility of the physical ticket), but that
means one has to &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; them, just like physical tickets, which is best done
with the trenitalia app (website should also work). I&rsquo;m not a great fan of
installing yet another app for that, but what I like is that it&rsquo;s at least one
app for all of Italy and not a federal mess of per-regional operator apps.</p>
<h3 id="layovers">layovers</h3>
<p>Compared to the Swiss train network, the Italian is frustrating in places. The
regional train leg I had, had a gap between trains of 2h, but then 2 trains
within 10 minutes. And on top of that, schedules of different lines don&rsquo;t
<strong>seem</strong> aligned to make good connections. I had one 1h59min layover to get
onto a regional train that ran only every 2h. To be fair, there were works
ongoing to increase the capacity of the line (thanks EU, btw), so that may have
been exceptionally sparse intervals in low season. And, due to reservations and
prejudice of delays, I anyway wouldn&rsquo;t have picked 10min layover connections.</p>
<h3 id="gotthard-base-tunnel">Gotthard base tunnel</h3>
<p>I travelled anti-cyclic on the long weekends. Which was nice not to have
everything booked out and crowded. But also means that (due to a recent
accident) passenger trains only go on holidays in the main travel direction
through the tunnel, and I went (against the main traffic) for a 1h detour
through the summit tunnel.</p>
