    <p>Disclaimer: Made up. Especially the people and their names.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing you wanted to do for quite some time now. A hike across some
pass in the Alps with a bit of via ferrata? You have the route figured out, the
forecast is promising, the weather in the past weeks was just right (there
won&rsquo;t be snow, avalanches, mud), you have the holidays booked, no last minute
fire at work. Last year the plan fell flat because of a mudslide that made the
valley inaccessible, the year before you caught Covid, next year you&rsquo;re already
booked out, and this year it&rsquo;s late in the year and not many potential weekends
left.</p>
<p>You have invited a few friends with whom you&rsquo;ve climbed mountain passes before.</p>
<p>And then</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it fine to invite Eddie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie is cool and you don&rsquo;t want to be exclusionary. So Eddie joins. And Eddie
likes the plan … but is far not as excited about it as you are - as you&rsquo;ll
later learn - and wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing anything else. And so Eddie asks if they
should bring Joey along … okay … Joey joins … and Joey is happy to do something
on the coming weekend and asks if people already have suggestions what to do
(he doesn&rsquo;t know what he signed up for?).</p>
<p>The thing is, Joey doesn&rsquo;t have a via ferrata kit and no experience and the
path isn&rsquo;t that easy that you could bring a beginner along. So the plan gets
changed. Instead of crossing the pass, it will stay in one of the valley and
turn into a 20k hike.</p>
<p>Until Joey mentions that he invited Carla and Mike. They had already thought
for quite a while about using a sunny weekend to do a 2h - wait! what&rsquo;s
happening? - hike in the mountains and suggest to cut the loop down to 1/3 and
then do a barbecue. People are already organizing the grill and food.</p>
<p>And since Freddy and Tom (where did they come from?) have a bit of a scheduling
conflict, it&rsquo;s now first barbecue and then hike.</p>
<p>Surely, you&rsquo;re at the grilling place at 11 as agreed. And at 14 the first round
of food is eaten and you mentally prepare for packing (wondering a bit how
everybody else behaves as if they have no more plans for the rest of the day)
when Martin and Constantine finally shows up and reignites the grill - does he
want to go on the hike with flip-flops? And by 16 people are chatting, and
someone mentions hiking and everybody agrees that hiking is actually a nice
activity and would&rsquo;ve been a nice alternative, Martin looks at you and says
that you even have proper shoes to go on a hike, though he always thought of
you to be more a via ferrata person and starting for a hike that late in the
day would probably be too short for your preferences.</p>
<p>Strangling everybody around you won&rsquo;t turn the clocks back to 8 and won&rsquo;t get
your equipment here. Next try in two years, try not to get injured, a job in a
new place, and start looking for a new group to do the tour with.</p>
