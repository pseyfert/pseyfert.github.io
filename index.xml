      <description>Given my activities in club during highschool years, I attended a couple of first aid courses, refreshers, paramedic courses, etc as standardized by various volunteer organizations in Germany. At a few occasions, breathing, oxygen processing by the body and such got discussed. And one of the teachers&#39; points usually was that the body gets all its oxygen through the air that we breath into the lung and none through the skin and that it was an urban myth that the skin breaths.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear, this is no work of my own. It is based on what Florian Lemaitre once explained to me and committed to the LHCb software.1 It was something that I had been wondering about for a while and hadn&amp;rsquo;t found resources on the internet.&#xA;Why not put it in production anymore? Thinking of the code that I write these days for production, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid it&amp;rsquo;s way more important to be able to debug and maintain the code base than to squeeze the last CPU cycle out of the performance.</description>
