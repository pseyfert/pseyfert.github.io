      <description>Disclaimer: Made up. Especially the people and their names.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s this thing you wanted to do for quite some time now. A hike across some pass in the Alps with a bit of via ferrata? You have the route figured out, the forecast is promising, the weather in the past weeks was just right (there won&amp;rsquo;t be snow, avalanches, mud), you have the holidays booked, no last minute fire at work.</description>
