      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear, this is no work of my own. It is based on what Florian Lemaitre once explained to me and committed to the LHCb software.1 It was something that I had been wondering about for a while and hadn&amp;rsquo;t found resources on the internet.&#xA;Why not put it in production anymore? Thinking of the code that I write these days for production, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid it&amp;rsquo;s way more important to be able to debug and maintain the code base than to squeeze the last CPU cycle out of the performance.</description>
