      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear, this is no work of my own. It is based on code that Florian Lemaitre once committed to the LHCb software.1 It was something that I had been wondering about for a while and hadn&amp;rsquo;t found resources on the internet.&#xA;The code has by now been removed from the LHCb repositories, though it still exists in the git history. The removal was done with the comment that superseded, outdated, or deprecated code was removed, even though my impression was that the code wasn&amp;rsquo;t adopted yet - Sadly, a fate that probably too much code faces: a fixed term contributor implements a functionality / provides an API, deploys it (with tests and documentation), but then with the advocate gone, nobody ever calls the function.</description>
