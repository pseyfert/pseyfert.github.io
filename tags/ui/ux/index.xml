      <description>&lt;p&gt;To make this post a bit LinkedIn compatible (why?), let&amp;rsquo;s open with something business:&#xA;The self-checkout cash registers at our local supermarket have &amp;lsquo;TOSHIBA&amp;rsquo; written on them.&#xA;I assume in some business to business negotiations that was agreed upon and effectively Toshiba is paying for having their brand name displayed on the terminal (or the supermarket would&amp;rsquo;ve needed to pay more to receive unbranded terminals). And I think this deal backfires because the UI has some flaws which make the product appear poorly designed or tested - so poorly that I&amp;rsquo;m writing a blog post about them. (Or maybe all publicity is good publicity, whatever, it&amp;rsquo;s not like I expect many readers).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
